    <h1>Chapter5: Images</h1>
    <h1>Target</h1>
    <p>Choosing the right format <br> Optimizing images for the web </p>
    <p>There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page:
        you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration,
        diagram, or chart.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Include an image in your web pages using HTML</li>
        <li>Pick which image format to use </li>
        <li>Show an image at the right size</li>
        <li>Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also use CSS to include images in your pages using
        the background-image property</p>
    <h1>Choosing images for you site</h1>
    <p>Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you
        can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from
        another website</p>
    <h1>Storing images on your site</h1>
    <p>If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
        practice to create a folder for all of the images
        the site uses.</p>
    <h1>Adding images</h1>
    <p>In HTML, use <code>&lt;img src="URL" alt="description"&gt;</code> to add an image.</p>
    <h2> <code>&lt;img&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>To add an image into the page you need to
        use an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. This is an empty
        element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry
        the following two attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>src</code>
            <br> This tells the browser where it can find
            the image file. This will usually be a relative
            URL pointing to an image on your own site
        </li>
        <li><code>alt</code>
            <br>This provides a text description of
            the image which describes the image if
            you cannot see it.
        </li>
        <li><code>title</code>
            <ol>You can also use the title attribute with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to provide additional
                information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when
                the user hovers over the image.</ol>
            <ol>The text used in the alt attribute is often referred to as alt text. It should give an accurate
                description of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software (used by people with
                visual impairments) and search engines.</ol>
            <ol>If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (and it has no meaning, such as a graphic
                dividing line), then the alt attribute should still be used but the quotes should be left empty.</ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
           quokka" title="The quokka is an Australia
           marsupial that is similar in size to the
           domestic cat." />
    <h1>Height & Width of images</h1>
    <h2>height</h2>
    <ul>This specifies the height of the image in pixels.</ul>
    <h2>with</h2>
    <ul>This specifies the width of the image in pixels.</ul>
    <p>The size of images is increasing being specified using CSS rather than HTML</p>
    <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />
    <h1>Aligning images horizontally</h1>
    <h2>align</h2>
    <p>It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images</p>
    <p>In HTML, use <code>&lt;img src="URL" alt="description" align="left/right/center"&gt;</code> to add an image.</p>
    <p>In HTML, use <code>&lt;img src="URL" alt="description" align="top/middle/bottom"&gt;</code> to add an image.</p>
    <p><img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" align="left" />There are around
        10,000 living species of birds that inhabit
        different ecosystems from the Arctic to the
        Antarctic. Many species undertake long distance
        annual migrations, and many more perform shorter
        irregular journeys.</p>

    <p><img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" align="right" />There are around
        10,000 living species of birds that inhabit
        different ecosystems from the Arctic to the

    <h1>HTML5: Figure and figute caption</h1>
    <h2><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>Images often come with
        captions. HTML5 has introduced
        a new <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element to
        contain images and their caption
        so that the two are associated.
        <br>
        You can have more than one
        image inside the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>
        element as long as they all share
        the same caption.
    </p>
    <h2><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element has
        been added to HTML5 in order
        to allow web page authors to add
        a caption to an image.
        <br>
        Older browsers that do not
        understand HTML5 elements
        simply ignore the new elements
        and display the content of them.
